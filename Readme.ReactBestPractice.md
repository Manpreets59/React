# best practices
 Seprate file for seprate component
 src(source code) folder to store entire code 
 Folder structure grouping by features or routes , grouping by file , avoid two much nesting 
 make sure to match component name for each file like if component start with capital letter then file also start with capital letter
 never keep any hardcoded data in component folder we use another folder for hardcoded data and the folder  name is common, utils
 good to have all constants name in capital letter 
 create state variable on top of inside functional component
